Pixelme is a course to teach pixel art to kids aged from 10 to 14. The course is divided by lessons, each lesson starts from the result from the prievious lesson. During the lessons the game of snake will be developed.
The kids will have no prior experience with programming. We will use javascript and html as programming languages and the browser as runtime, this has to happen on an online javascript collaborative platform.

Lesson 1
We explain the bit concept in computer science, what a bit can rapresent: 0 1, true false, on off, black white pixel
Based on a cartesian plane we will create a bit that will translate in displaying the bit on screen with a pixel.

Lesson 2 
We explain the concept of variable, operations on the variables and loop to show the animation concept by moving the pixel on the screen with a loop and functions on the coordinates of the pixel

Lesson 3
We will introduce the movements with binding the pixel to the keyboard arrows.

Lesson 4
We will introduce the concept of arrays and arrays of array to rapresent a matrix of bits and display the matrix on the screen.

Lesson 5
We will move the pixel as the snake in the game, by using the arrows to control it and we explain collision detection with the points in the matrix.

Lesson 6
We will make the pixel that collide with the snake disappear from the screen and the snake grow. So we need to create a structure for the snake

Lesson 7
Implement collision detection with the snake itself and game over screen
