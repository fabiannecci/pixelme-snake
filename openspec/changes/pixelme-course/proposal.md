## Why

Create an engaging programming course for kids aged 10-14 with no prior coding experience, teaching fundamental CS concepts (bits, variables, loops, arrays, functions, collision detection) through building a Snake game incrementally across 7 lessons. Each lesson builds on the previous, using JavaScript and HTML in CodePen for immediate, collaborative visual feedback.

## What Changes

- Create a reusable **lesson framework** for structuring CodePen-based lessons with consistent navigation and code organization
- Build a modular **Snake game engine** with progressive feature unlocks aligned to each lesson's learning objectives
- Develop **7 progressive lessons** with starter code, solution code, and educational materials for each concept:
  - Lesson 1: Bits and pixel rendering (single pixel on Cartesian plane)
  - Lesson 2: Variables, operations, loops, and animation (moving pixel)
  - Lesson 3: Event binding and keyboard controls (arrow keys)
  - Lesson 4: Arrays and matrices (grid of pixels)
  - Lesson 5: Snake movement and collision detection with food
  - Lesson 6: Data structures and snake growth mechanics
  - Lesson 7: Self-collision detection and game-over state

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `lesson-framework`: Reusable structure for CodePen-based lessons including HTML templates, CSS for pixel rendering, navigation between lessons, and code embedding conventions
- `snake-game-engine`: Modular JavaScript game engine with progressive features (pixel rendering, input handling, grid system, snake entity, collision detection, game state management)
- `lesson-sequence`: Seven lesson specifications defining learning outcomes, concepts introduced, starter code templates, solution code, and how each lesson scaffolds from the previous

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- None; this is a new course from scratch -->

## Impact

- CodePen collection with 7 progressive lessons
- Starter code templates for each lesson (students begin here)
- Solution code for each lesson (instructors reference, students compare)
- Lesson materials (HTML/Markdown) embedded in CodePen with explanations
- Modular game engine code that can be extended beyond the 7 lessons
