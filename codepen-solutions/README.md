# PixelMe Solutions Collection

This directory contains the **solution code** for all 7 lessons. These are for instructor reference and student comparison after completing each lesson.

## Structure

Each lesson folder contains:
- `index.html` - HTML section (same as starter)
- `styles.css` - CSS section (same as starter)
- `script.js` - JavaScript section with **COMPLETE SOLUTION**

## Important Note

**Lesson progression**: Each lesson's solution code becomes the foundation for the next lesson's starter code (with new TODO sections added).

For example:
- Lesson 1 solution → Lesson 2 starter (+ new TODOs for animation)
- Lesson 2 solution → Lesson 3 starter (+ new TODOs for keyboard)
- And so on...

## How to Create Solutions Collection on CodePen

1. Create a new CodePen collection called "PixelMe Course - Solutions"
2. For each lesson, create a pen with the solution code
3. Keep the collection unlisted or private to avoid spoiling students
4. Share individual solution links with students after they complete each lesson
